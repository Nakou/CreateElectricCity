This mod is not yet ready to be played with.
It's still very unstable and should not be installed on a server or client except for testing.

# Stolen Stuff

This basecode is heavily inspired (if not straight up stolen) from the following projects : 
- Create : Crafts & Additions (needed so i could integrate my lights as connectors)
- Create : Better Motors (my jumping point into making an addon to an addon to a mod, structure of this project is basically a copy/paste that I purged and then rebuilt)
- Create : The Factory Must Grow (Lights, Light glow and way to implement lights as variants are concepts basically inspired/Stolen from there, I wanted the same thing but integrated with the C&A FE & connector systems, that's where the idea for this mod comes from)

# Create Electric City
Addon to the Create mod by witch-captain nakou.

# About

Create : Electric City extends Create and Crafts & Additions by adding some more blocs and item using electricity systems (like the one from C&A).

# Content

- A light bubble!

# Stolen Stuff

This basecode is heavily inspired (if not straight up stolen) from the following projects : 
- Create : Crafts & Additions (needed so i could integrate my lights as connectors)
- Create : Better Motors (my jumping point into making an addon to an addon to a mod, structure of this project is basically a copy/paste that I purged and then rebuilt)
- Create : The Factory Must Grow (Lights, Light glow are basically inspired/Stolen from there, I wanted the same thing but integrated with the C&A FE & connector systems)
